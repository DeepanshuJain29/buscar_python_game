## BUSCAR :exclamation::exclamation:

It is a Block Searching game made in Python using Pygame module.

  

## PLAYING BUSCAR :joystick:

To play BUSCAR, you must have ` Python 2.7 ` and ` Pygame ` installed in the system.

  

`final_version` directory have the latest version we created along with its required files.

  

Also, to run any of the `previous_version`s, you may place in the same directory as of the resources in `final_version` or you may replace the `29_BUSCAR.py` with the intended version.

  

## BUSCAR_ADVANCED :neutral_face:

In `graphical_version` we have added some graphical elements to the game, to present it in an Event in our High School. (Yea, that is all advanced it is :upside_down_face:).
